# Best Hospital Location in Jeollanam-do, South Korea

## Project Overview

This project conducts a comprehensive analysis of social service data with a focus on Jeollanam-do, a region in South Korea with the highest proportion of elderly citizens. The rapidly aging population in this area necessitates a deep understanding of the social services provided and potential improvements to the current policy infrastructure.

Our inspiration stems from the report "Social Services: Current Status and Policy Implications" authored by Ahn Soo-ran, an associate researcher at the Korea Institute for Health and Social Affairs. Although the report indicates that a significant part of the social services is provided by the Ministry of Health and Welfare, a deeper exploration of the situation specific to Jeollanam-do is necessary.

In this project, we specifically target the issue of hospital location selection in Jeollanam-do. Our goal is to identify the optimal location for a hospital considering various factors such as population distribution, gender ratio, and the region's topography. We aim to provide a direction for enhancing the hospital infrastructure in Jeollanam-do.

This project was used in the data analysis course for social services.
